    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 1.Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. Flask aims to keep the core of the application simple yet extensible. Flask has become popular among developers due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework, making it easy to learn and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Flexibility: Flask allows developers to choose the components they want to use, which makes it a flexible framework for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Modular: Flask is designed to be modular, allowing developers to add functionality as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Easy to get started: Flask has a small learning curve, and it's easy to get started with building web applications using this framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Good documentation: Flask has excellent documentation, making it easy for developers to find answers to their questions and solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Large community: Flask has a large community of developers who contribute to the framework's development, ensuring that it stays up-to-date and relevant."

    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of defining URL patterns and associating them with view functions that generate responses. It is a way of mapping URLs in your web application to Python functions that will be executed when a user visits those URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, we use app routes to define the behavior of our web application when a particular URL is accessed. App routes allow us to specify which function should handle a request for a specific URL pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes to create different pages or views in our web application. Each view can have its own unique URL pattern, and Flask's routing mechanism ensures that requests to those URLs are handled appropriately. We can also pass parameters to app routes, allowing us to create dynamic views that vary based on user input or other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, app routes in Flask provide a clean and flexible way to define the behavior of our web application and make it easy for users to access the different pages and functionality within it."
